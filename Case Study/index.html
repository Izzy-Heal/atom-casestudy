    <h1>Atom Case Study</h1>
    <p>
        Atom is a habit-tracking application that aims to use the social connections to help people stay on track of habits and goals in their lives. 
        This application was built over six months and featured three main phases: initial research, application flow, and user testing, and final building and development.
        These three phases helped us create a functional finished product as well as helped teach us a lot about the design process.

    <h2>Team & Background</h2>
    <img src="images/the-team.png">
    <p>
        Across a six-month period, our team aimed to build a habit-tracking app. 
        Our only real constraints and budget were the time we had and the skills that we had learned over the past three years in the UXID program.
    </p>    

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Changing aspects of your life can be very difficult on your own. Managing all of the small habits that go into making a larger 
        lifestyle change can take a lot of effort, and holding yourself accountable to those habits is often a challenge. </p>
    
    <h2>Deliverables & Objectives</h2>
    <p>Atom seeks to provide users with the ability to manage their goals and the habits that help them build towards those goals. It is also community focused, 
        allowing you to add your friends or team members and hold each other accountable for the changes they want to make in their lives. 
        The goals of the project are to create a functioning web app that allows users to add goals and habits, and connect with other users in groups. </p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>The first step of the project was research, and we did quite a lot of it. 
        Because habits are something that has a fair amount of psychology research done on them that was our fist stop. 
        We compiled and synthesized several sources on the topic in order to give us a clearer direction on the methods we would use to keep tracking their habits. 
        This paper can be downladed as a PDF <a href="images/ATOM - User Psychology.pdf" target = "_blank"download>here.</a> The main conclusions 
    that we found from this research that we looked to incorperate into every step of our design process when builing the app are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reminders and repetition</li>
        <li>Breaking up goals into micro habits helps keep </li>
        <li>Pressure from groups will keep users engaged</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We completed target user research in order to gain more insight into our target audience. Our target users are college aged studdents who have a lot of different
         tasks that thethey need to manage to keep up with in their packed schedules. We created use personas to go along with the target audience research. We created these personas
         to keep us thinking about our user all throughout the design process. We were constantly able to reference
         these personas and consider what these users would want. </p>
         <img src="images/personas.png">
        <p>We also did a competitive analysis in order to see what other habit tracking was doing well that we could iterate on and what areas they needed to 
        improve so we could avoid those shortcomings.</p>
        <img src="images/Competitive-analysis.png">
    <h3>Wireframes & User Testing</h3>
    <p>Once we had a good understanding of the psychology, users, and competitors we started the creation of our wireframes, as well as moodboards, and concepts for 
        the look and feel of the app. This focus on the aesthetic early on became a problem later down the line, but we shall get to that. </p>
        <img src="images/initial-wirefames.png">
        <img src="images/initial-styleguide.png">
    <p>Now that we had our first wireframe flow we started on user testing, then making changes based upon the test results, this process was repeated multiple times
         throughout the fall quarter, and with each run through we got closer to our final flow concept but there was something about the flow and the way we differentiated 
         between goals and habits that was not clicking with our users.</p>
        <img src="images/mid-wireframes.png">
    <p>Coming back from break this disconnect was the big thing that we needed to find a solution for, so we created a bunch of new user flows that addressed the problem in 
        different ways. We alsp created a new color scheme to test alongside the original concept, and our current dark blue and orange scheme. The feedback we received 
        from testing the flows and colors gave us information that the new color scheme with shades of teal and orange reflected both a fun personality without going overboard. 
        We were also able to pull the concepts from the different flows that users found to be the best and combined them to create a flow that addressed the issues we
         were having and was preferred by the users.</p>

    <img src="images/final-styleguide.png">
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>Now that we had our flow much more honed in and our styling decided, we started on the development. This app was created using react and firebase. The components of 
        the application were built in such a way that they could be reused in multiple different sections instead of having to rebuild components over and over again, 
        the ability to reuse and edit the components made the front-end development a much more streamlined process than it potentially could have been. Once all of
         the components and screens were built out it was time to connect them to the back-end database code that had been worked on concurrently with the front-end. </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Video walkthrough with descriptions (to do)</p>

    <p>We also created a video to showcase a potential user's experience with the application</p>

    <h2>Results & Takeaways</h2>
    <p>In the end, we were able to create an application that fulfills our base-level concept. There were certainly features that we wish we could have added but given the nature of the 
        project having this core functionality makes this project successful. Also the amount that we were able to learn over the course of these six months is a huge success. </p>
    <p>There were a nearly uncountable number of moments of learning from this project. From time management group leadership and communication to a greater understanding 
        of the purpose and usefulness of all of the steps of the design process. In the future, we would put more work into our upfront organization as a team to help keep us all 
        on track and help take the burden off of the project manager to constantly be assigning new tasks. Another big lesson we learned was just how many steps and processes go 
        into the creation of a project like this. Up until this point we had not the opportunity to work from start to finish on an application in this way and doing all of the
         different aspects of the project together as a small team really showed so much more of how much work goes into every piece of technology we interact with on a daily basis. </p>
